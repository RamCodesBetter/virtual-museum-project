                <h3>How Did the Battle of Opis Start and End?</h3>
                <p>
                    King Nabonidus of Babylonia started the Battle of Opis in September 539 B.C.E when he sent his army to prepare
                    for
                    battle with Cyrus the Great and his army. They headed towards the Tigris River, where the army of Cyrus the
                    Great was
                    waiting at. The battle then began at a local city along the Tigris River and north of Babylon: named Opis. Cyrus
                    the
                    Great's army heroically defeated King Nabonidus on September 28th, three days after the war began, which
                    livius.org
                    mentions: “and the native population revolted against its government. Without further fighting, Cyrus marched to
                    and
                    captured Babylon.”

                <h3>What Happened in the Battle of Opis?</h3>
                <p>
                    After conquering Lydia, Cyrus went for Mesopotamia, specifically the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Soon, Cyrus went to
                    war with
                    Babylonia and in the September of 539 B.C.E, both armies met, including Cyrus and the Babylonian king Nabonidus
                    and
                    crown prince Belshazzar, in the city of Opis along the Tigris River. The “Persian war machine”, according to
                    thecollector.com and worldhistory.com, drived and demolished the Babylonian army. Not just destroying the army,
                    the
                    Persians looted valuable goods and murdered those who repelled. This also included Nabonidus's son: Belshazzar.
                    Shortly
                    after the war, a riot started on Nabonidus trust, which broke out in Akkad. He won but before long, they
                    overthrew
                    Nabonidus, which started to lead to the fall of Babylon and the rise of the Persian Empire. Adding on, since
                    Belshazzar
                    died in battle, the city and area was now under Cyrus's hands.

                <h3>What Was the Purpose of the Battle of Opis?</h3>
                <p>
                    The Battle of Opis fought from the Neo-babylonian Empire and the Achaemenid Empire had an important reason for
                    getting
                    an abundance of loot. Opis was near the Tigris River, north of Babylon, and very close to the end of the Median
                    Wall,
                    which was built by Nebuchadnezzar II to protect Babylon from invasions, specifically Median invasions. Once the
                    Persian
                    army got control of Opis, they were able to rummage through the wall and plunder through the Babylonian capital.

                <h3>How Did the Babylonians Lose the Battle of Opis?</h3>
                <p>
                    The Babylonians lost by the sneakiness and cleverness of the Persians. Babylon's walls were impenetrable, but
                    the
                    Persians adroitly created a plan where they would divert the course of the Euphrates River, so it was shallow
                    enough to
                    be doable with. A couple days later, the residents were completely distracted by a major religious banquet, so
                    the
                    Persians squelched through the water and with effort, went under the wall. This sneaky and clever plan led to
                    them
                    effortlessly taking the city without a scrimmage. Although some ancient documents imply that the walls were in
                    need of
                    repair, the effort of the Persians crossing the bridge could have been less.

                <h3>What Factors Contributed to the Babylonian Defeat at Opis?</h3>
                <p>
                    As mentioned before, the Babylonian Empire fell in 539 B.C.E, one of its causes being the Battle of Opis. But
                    the
                    Babylonian's defeat had many factors to its defeat. First of all, the Persians as said before, had weak walls
                    that were
                    in need of repair. So that made it easier for the Persian army to enter the Babylonian capital. Second of all,
                    King
                    Nabonidus was not known and unpopular due to his religious policies under priesthood. Third of all, at the time,
                    Babylonia was having economic problems, the major ones being famine and plague. Fourth of all, Babylonia had a
                    geopolitical situation regarding the border because they bordered the Persian Empire on the north, east and west
                    borders. Finally, Nabonidus was making changes to the priesthood including suppressing the cult of Marduk and
                    centralizing the religion of Babylonia in the temple of Marduk.

                <h3>How Did the Battle of Opis Impact Mesopotamia?</h3>
                <p>
                    The Battle of Opis had a negative impact on Mesopotamia, leading to the fall of the Babylonian Empire and part
                    of the
                    lead to the Persian invasion of Mesopotamia. The Persians had the Battle of Opis, a battle where the Persians
                    tried to
                    get control of the capital of Babylonia and get major loot, which they succeeded upon. The battle had an
                    aftermath where
                    a revolt occurred in Akkad, which King Nabonidus let down but later got overthrew. In October 539 B.C.E, the
                    Persian
                    Empire eventually took over Babylon which later became a Persian satrapy. Cyrus showed himself as a traditional
                    Mesopotamian monarch releasing political prisoners and restoring great temples.
